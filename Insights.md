# Analysis and Findings

- ## Regional NDVI Trends:
  - Mauritania: NDVI values remained relatively stable and low throughout the year, indicating consistent but sparse vegetation cover.
  - Rajasthan: Showed dynamic vegetation changes with significant fluctuations in NDVI values, highlighting a more variable ecosystem.
  - Wadi Rum: Exhibited minor NDVI fluctuations, suggesting a more stable vegetation cover similar to Mauritania.

- ## Correlation with Rainfall:
  - Mauritania: A moderate negative correlation between NDVI and rainfall was observed, suggesting that higher rainfall doesn't necessarily lead to better vegetation health.
  - Rajasthan: A weaker negative correlation indicated other factors, such as soil quality or irrigation practices, may play a significant role.
  - Wadi Rum: A slight positive correlation suggested that even small rainfall events positively impact vegetation health.
