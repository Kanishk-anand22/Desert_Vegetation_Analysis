Analyzing NDVI and Rainfall Patterns in Desert Ecosystems Using Satellite Data

## Introduction 
As climate change continues to impact our planet, understanding how ecosystems respond to environmental shifts is more critical than ever. This project analyzes vegetation health using NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and rainfall patterns in three desert regions: the Thar Desert in Rajasthan, India, Wadi Rum in Jordan, and parts of the Sahara Desert in Mauritania. 

## Objective Examine the relationship between vegetation health and rainfall in these arid regions over the course of 2023. 

## Data Sources

**Sentinel-2 Imagery**: [Sentinel-2 User Guide](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi) 

**CHIRPS Rainfall Data**: [CHIRPS](https://www.chc.ucsb.edu/data/chirps) 

**Google Earth Engine**: [Google Earth Engine](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine) 

## Methodology - Data collection using Google Earth Engine. - NDVI calculation from Sentinel-2 imagery. - Rainfall data extraction from CHIRPS. - Correlation analysis between NDVI and rainfall. - Visualization of trends and patterns.
